Hello! My name is **Yunfan (Justin) Long**. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), pursuing double majors in Data Science (BS) and Computer Engineering (BS), with a [Major GPA (Upper Div)](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/grading-and-gpa-calculations/) of 4.0 in both. I am expected graduate in June 2024.

My primary research interest is centered around the development and optimization of <u>Computer Vision</u> models on <u>Scene Recognition</u> tasks, specifically for out-of-distribution image. Leveraging my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis, I've made significant contributions to various research and internship projects in the healthcare industry.


Currently, I am working as a research assistant in Professor [Garrison Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/)'s [Computer Vision Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/guru/index.html) mentored by Dr. [Martha Gahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martha-gahl-588139105/) on a Computer Vision project. Deeply interested in the application of advanced ML & AI techniques to the biomedical and healthcare sectors, I am researching & interning in the [Qualcomm Institute Research Organization](https://qi.ucsd.edu/), contributing to the development of a mobile health software that help diagnose PTSD only from ECG signal, advised by [Dr. Ramesh Rao](https://iem.ucsd.edu/researchers/people/profiles/ramesh-rao.html) and [Dr. Mingxiong Huang](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/mingxiong.huang). At UCSD Health, I'm a undergraduate researcher in Dr. [Michael Hogarth](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/michael.hogarth)'s Nightingale Lab on an applied NLP project. I'm also working under Dr. [Ying Choon Wu](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/michael.hogarth)'s [Insight Center](https://insight.ucsd.edu/our-team/) on EEG-related VR research. Learn more at [Research](/research).


Beyond research, I have a deep passion for education. As an 7-time undergraduate teaching assistant, I've continuously supported 3 courses for the past year across the Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science departments, aiding over 1,200 students in their academic journeys. Collaborating with 5 faculty members, I've sought to elevate the course experiences for UCSD students. In my teaching endeavors, I am primarily mentored by Dr. [Justin Eldridge](https://eldridgejm.github.io/) and Dr. [Marina Langlois](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/marina-langlois/).

Beyond academics, I'm a jazz band drummer who has two dogs. Discover more at [Life](/life).
