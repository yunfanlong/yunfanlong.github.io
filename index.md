## About Me

Hello! My name is **Yunfan Long**. I am a first-year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, pursuing an MS degree in Computational Data Science, with an expected graduation in May 2026. I am actively seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2025.


During my undergraduate studies at UCSD, my primary research focus was on developing and optimizing computer vision models for scene recognition tasks, specifically targeting out-of-distribution images. Leveraging my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis, I contributed significantly to various research and internship projects, particularly within the healthcare industry.


Previously, I worked as a research assistant in Professor [Garrison Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/)'s [Computer Vision Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/guru/index.html) mentored by Dr. [Martha Gahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martha-gahl-588139105/) on a Computer Vision project. Deeply interested in the application of advanced ML & AI techniques to the biomedical and healthcare sectors, I researched & interned in the [Qualcomm Institute Research Organization](https://qi.ucsd.edu/) and contributed to the development of a mobile health software by implementing a CNN-based model to help diagnose PTSD only from ECG signal and a tranformer-based model to detect epileptic spikes, advised by Professor [Ramesh Rao](https://iem.ucsd.edu/researchers/people/profiles/ramesh-rao.html) and Professor [Mingxiong Huang](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/mingxiong.huang). Both models achieved leading performance, and the results are awaiting publication. At [UCSD Health](https://health.ucsd.edu), I was an undergraduate researcher working on applied NLP projects in Professor [Michael Hogarth](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/michael.hogarth)'s Nightingale Lab. I worked under Professor [Virginia de Sa](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/virginia-de-sa.html) at [Institute for Neural Computation](https://inc.ucsd.edu/index.php) mentored by Dr. [Ying Choon Wu](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/yingchoon.wu) on EEG-related VR research. Learn more at [Research](/research).


Beyond research, I have a deep passion for teaching. As an 8-time undergraduate teaching assistant, I've continuously supported 4 courses for the past two years across the <u>Computer Science and Engineering</u> and <u>Data Science</u> departments, aiding over 1,500 students in their academic journeys. Collaborating with 6 faculty members, I've sought to elevate the course experiences for UCSD students. In my teaching endeavors, I am primarily mentored by Dr. [Justin Eldridge](https://eldridgejm.github.io/) and Dr. [Marina Langlois](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/marina-langlois/).

Beyond academics, I'm a jazz band drummer who has two dogs. Discover more at [Life](/life).
